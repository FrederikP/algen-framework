\section*{Dynamic Perfect Hashing - Implementation}

by Lennart Hensler and Frederik Petersen

\section{Introduction}

Dynamic perfect hashing allows for constant find and amortized constant inserts.
We implemented a variant based on \cite{di94}, which uses a two layer approach
to avoid the need of $ n^2 $ space. The outer layer consists of a number of
buckets with a hash function that distributes the data into the buckets. There
may be collisions. Each bucket has its own inner hash function and allows
perfect hashing. If perfect hashing can not be provided in a bucket the data
structure can be resized and/or new hash functions are generated depending on
some conditions. It can also be necessary to completely rehash the table. \cite{di94} describes two reasons to do this.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item A counter of the hash table is greater or equals to a threshold.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item The counter is increased when a new key is inserted in the table and when an entry is deleted.
    \item The threshold depends on the amount of entries that are contained by the table.
  \end{itemize}
  \item A global condition isn't satisfied after a bucket has been resized.
\end{enumerate}

\section {Approaches}

We implemented three different approaches for dynamic perfect hashing. The first two stick close to \cite{di94}, but have different data structures. The third tries to solve the problem workload based instead of operation count based. The implementations of these approaches are available on github\footnote{\href{https://github.com/FrederikP/algen-framework}{https://github.com/FrederikP/algen-framework}}.

\subsection{Storing all entries in a single vector}

At first we tried to store all the entries in one single array instead of using multiple buckets as described in \cite[p. 94]{mesa08}. The buckets are represented with meta information like the index of the start of the bucket, the bucket length and its hash function. We had a lot of issues due to the immense copying/moving needed, when resizing one of the buckets. This could be avoided when giving all the buckets some extra space in the array, which they can grow into without the need to touch other buckets. This, again, would increase the space requirements. This approach is in the file \texttt{DPH\_with\_single\_vector.h}.

\subsection{Storing the entries in buckets}

In this variant every bucket stores the data in its own vector and the table consists of a vector of buckets. This implementation is much more efficient than the simple approach with a single vector. We implemented this approach in two different ways. The first sticks close to \cite{di94} (rehashing logic, counters for the table and the buckets) and is in the file \texttt{DPH\_with\_buckets.h}. In the second one we removed the counters and the thresholds and the resizing/rehashing is now based on the amount of elements contained by the table/bucket and its capacity. This approach is in the file \texttt{DPH\_with\_buckets\_2.h}. We isolated six parameters, that affect the performance and the needed space for the approaches with buckets.

\section{Parameters}

Several parameters have an impact on the performance and needed space of the
algorithm. We will have a look at several parameters here.

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Bucket Capacity Factor}\\
  	How much bigger than the number of current elements will a bucket be created for (capacity-wise). In the approach with counters and thresholds the threshold of a bucket is equal to its capacity.
  \item \textbf{Bucket Length Factor}\\
    How much bigger than the desired capacity will a bucket be. The smaller this is, the faster the data structure needs to be updated. The larger it is, the more space is needed per element.
  \item \textbf{Maximum Number of Rehash Attempts}\\
  	How often can the guessing of a new injective hash function of a bucket fail, before the bucket gets resized. The smaller it is, the faster is the rehashing. But if this value is to small, it's possible that the bucket becomes bigger than necessary.
  \item \textbf{Rehash Length Factor}\\
    The factor the bucket length will be multiplied with, if the maximum number of rehash attempts is exceeded. The bigger it is, the more unlikely it's necessary to resize the bucket again. But if this value is to big, the bucket will become bigger than necessary.
  \item \textbf{Table Capacity Factor}\\
    In the approach with counters and thresholds this parameter affects the threshold of the table: $ threshold = (1 + factor) * \max(elementAmount, 4) $
    In the pragmatic approach the capacity of the table is equal to the number of contained elements multiplied with the factor.
  \item \textbf{Element Amount per Bucket}\\
    The starting capacity of the buckets after the table has been initialized or rehashed. The bigger it is, the less buckets will be created.
\end{itemize}

After some experimenting with these parameters, the following values seem to create the best results. For each parameter we created several table instances with different values for the parameter to optimize, in which the other parameters stayed the same.

\hline Maximum Number of Rehash Attempts & 5 & 5 \\ 
\hline Rehash Length Factor & 2 & 2 \\

\hline Element Amount per Bucket & 3500 & 3000 \\

\section{Experiments}

We ran our experiments on a quad core Intel Atom server running a 32bit Debian
Jessie OS with 4GB of RAM. The benchmarks were run automatically each time a
code update was pushed to the repository and plots were generated and saved per
build. That allowed us to test different parameters and compare them to the
earlier builds.

The processor was a Intel Atom D525. It does not have an L3 cache and sadly PAPI
instrumentation for cache misses didn't work for L1 and L2. It clocks at 1.8GHz.

In addition to the requirements of the algorithm
framework\footnote{\href{https://github.com/lorenzhs/algen-framework}{https://github.com/lorenzhs/algen-framework}}
our algorithms also need the primesieve library installed for quick finding of
prime numbers as they are essential for the universal hash functions.

We included the result graphs at the end of this document. We do not present
results for the single array variant, since it was too slow to be competetive.\\
